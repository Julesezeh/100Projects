A prime number is a number that is evenly
divisible only by one and itself. Prime numbers
have a variety of practical applications,
but no algorithm can predict them; we must
calculate them one at a time. However, we do know
that there is an infinite number of prime numbers to
be discovered.

1.This imports a function "factor_finder" from the factorfinder module.
2.A function that returns True if a number is a prime number is created from this imported function. (is_prime)
3.A function that returns all prime numbers from zero to the number specified is also created. (all_prime_numbers)
