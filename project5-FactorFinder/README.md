A number’s factors are any two other numbers
that, when multiplied with each other,
produce the number. For example, 2 × 13 =
26, so 2 and 13 are factors of 26. Also, 1 × 26 =
26, so 1 and 26 are also factors of 26. Therefore, we
say that 26 has four factors: 1, 2, 13, and 26.
If a number only has two factors (1 and itself), we call that a prime
number. Otherwise, we call it a composite number. Use the factor finder to
discover some new prime numbers! (Hint: Prime numbers always end with
an odd number that isn’t 5.)
