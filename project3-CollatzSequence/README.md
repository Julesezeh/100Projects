The Collatz sequence, also called the 3n + 1
problem, is the simplest impossible math
problem. (But donâ€™t worry, the program
itself is easy enough for beginners.) From a
starting number, n, follow three rules to get the next
number in the sequence:
1. If n is even, the next number n is n / 2.
2. If n is odd, the next number n is n * 3 + 1.
3. If n is 1, stop. Otherwise, repeat.
It is generally thought, but so far not mathematically proven, that
every starting number eventually terminates at 1.
