Our website needs to trick people into
looking at advertisements! But coming up
with creative, original content is too hard.
Luckily, with the clickbait headline generator,
we can make a computer come up with millions of
outrageous fake headlines. They’re all low quality, but
readers don’t seem to mind. This program generates
as many headlines as you need from a Mad Libs–style
template.
